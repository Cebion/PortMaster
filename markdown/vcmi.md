## Notes

Thanks to [VCMI Team](https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi) for the open source Heroes of Might and Magic III engine that makes this possible.  Also thanks to the [kloptops](https://github.com/kloptops/Portmaster-misc/tree/main/VCMI) for the porting work for portmaster.

## Detailed Instructions

You need to add required game files either from CD1 & CD2, GoG or an installed copy of the game. <br>  This requires about 2-3 gb of free space. For the gog version copy setup_heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_4.0_(28740)-1.bin and setup_heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_4.0_(28740).exe into ports/vcmi. <br>  For the cd version copy the contents of cd1 into ports/vcmi/cd1 and cd2 into ports/vcmi/cd2. For the installed version copy installed game files into ports/vcmi/install.
