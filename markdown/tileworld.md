## Notes

To play the original Chip's Challenge levels, copy your chips.dat file into ports/tileworld/data folder and make sure it's lowercase. 

Thanks to [Ricardo Angeli](https://github.com/rangeli/tileworld) for this emulation port of Chip's Challenge created by Chuck Sommerville.  Also thanks to Slayer366 for the porting work for portmaster.
