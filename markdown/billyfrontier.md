## Notes

Use the touchscreen to navigate the U and some gameplay. Currently only runs on the RG552 with Jelos installed.

Thanks to Pangea Software for creating the game and publicly releasing the game files. Thanks to [Jorio](https://github.com/jorio/BillyFrontier) for porting the game engine to various platforms. Also thanks to brooksytech for the porting work for portmaster.
