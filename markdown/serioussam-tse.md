## Notes

Thanks to ptitseb for this source port for Serious Sam (Classic).

On some devices the 'Select' button does not get mapped to 'Esc'.  If you encounter this, use 'L2'.
To invert right joystick look, set mouse-look invert under Options -> Players and Controls -> Customize Controls.  
On some devices 'Select+B' will invoke the menu.

### Game data files needed:

Copy all contents except the 'Bin' folder from your Serious Sam - The Second Encounter Classic install and DO NOT overwrite existing files.
Use your GOG, Steam, or CD version.  The Serious Sam Classics: Revolution copy of The Second Encounter should work, too.
Copy The Second Encounter's contents to /sstse/
