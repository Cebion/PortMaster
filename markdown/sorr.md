## Notes

Thanks to [josebagar](https://gitlab.com/josebagar/bennugd-monolithic) for the update to the bennugd-monolithic that made this possible.
Thanks to [isage](https://github.com/isage/sorr-vita) for the slow down fix that benefits this platform.


## Detailed Instructions

1. Obtain any version of SorR. You can use either the windows or linux/debian version it does not matter which.

2. Extract them /roms/ports/sorr (For RG351V if using SD2, extract to /roms2/ports/sorr instead). You should have a /mod folder, a /palettes folder, and SorR.dat file in this location in order for the game to work.

3. Then go to Ports, and launch SorR
Note: If you experience a slowdown in gameplay after sometime, force exit the game (You can use the normal force exit hotkey combination for your device), then start the game again and it will start from the beginning of the last stage you were on and be full speed for a few more stages. It's the best workaround for the issue for now until someone can figure out and resolve the root cause of the slowdown. [Fixed as of 10/6/2021]
