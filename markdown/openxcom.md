## Notes

**Never enable OpenGL or it will crash immediately on loading (which can be fixed by editing the .cfg file and turning it back off there)**
Thanks to [MeridianOXC](https://github.com/MeridianOXC/OpenXcom) and contributors for the open-source ports that makes this possible.  Also thanks to nl255 for the porting work for portmaster.
