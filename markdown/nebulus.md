## Notes

Thanks to [Andreas RÃ¶ver](https://gitlab.com/roever) for this remake of a classic game. 

Text input is enabled with Start + Down but really only works for the password screen, the player name will not easily allow text input.

If the game is running slower on lower end devices, you can reduce the graphics in the menu.
