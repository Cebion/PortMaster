## Notes

To use mods and addons for SRB2, just add the relevant files to ports/SRB2/conf/.srb2/addons and load them using Add Ons menu item while in the game.

Thanks to [Sonic Team Junior](https://github.com/STJr/SRB2) for creating this opensource fan game.  Also thanks to romadu for the packaging for portmaster.
