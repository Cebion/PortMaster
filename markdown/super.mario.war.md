## Notes

Thanks to [Mátyás Mustoha](https://github.com/mmatyas/supermariowar) for continuing the work originally started by Samuele Poletto and then Florian Hufsky to make this game what it is today.


## Netplay Instructions

Netplay: There's a netplay feature available with the portmaster version that supports network play between multiple units. According to the author (mmatyas) of this feature, it is very much experimental so performance will vary depending on a a number of factors not limited to network latency, connection quality (2.4Ghz vs 5Ghz, vs Wired connection) and if attempting to play over Internet, lag and disconnects. To use this feature: you can do the following:

One of players has to run the server. This can be done from the netplay menu provided when you launch Super Mario War from the PortMaster version.
Server IPs can be added from the netplay menu from within settings. The netplay menu will allow you to easily set Server 1 as your internal IP address, Server 2 as your external IP address. You can also set alternative addresses for these servers as well.
Make sure to start the server before you start Super Mario War. Once started, you can join the server using your internal IP address. The other players will need to join via your internal IP if playing on the same local network or your external IP if joining via Internet.
Be aware that if playing over internet, the unit with the smw server started must have port forwarding on that wifi or wired router's configuration for UDP 12521 to point to the internal IP of the unit running the smw server. If this is not done, Internet based players may not be able to join the smw server.
Once connected, a room must be created with a name. With the PortMaster setup, the x and y button can be used to just name the room x or y so the room can be setup and all players can enter the room and start playing.
