## Notes

If you plan to use a full GOG version of the assets,there's a file HOSP/DATAM/DEMO.DAT that needs to be deleted when full game files are added or the port will be confused about whether what version is played, and erroneously checks the GOG files as invalid file sizes. See this[ issue](https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH/issues/2092) for more information. 

Thanks to [CorsixTH](https://github.com/CorsixTH/CorsixTH) team for creating this clone of Theme Hospital.
