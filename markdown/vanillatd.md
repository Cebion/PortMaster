## Notes

If you want to play the full version, you will need to place the game files from the following guide into ports/vanillatd/data/vanillatd. <br>   You will need to delete all the game files in ports/vanillatd/data/vanillatd before installing full game files.

Thanks to [Vanilla Conquer](https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Vanilla-Conquer) and other contributors for the build.  Also thanks to kloptops and Snoopy from the AmberElec Discord for the porting work.
