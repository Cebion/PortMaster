## Notes

You'll need to source your own am2r android apk and place it into the ports/am2r/gamedata folder. Make sure it is named am2r.apk. If need be, just rename the am2r apk you source to am2r.apk. The name is case sensitive!

Thanks to JohnnyonFlame for the[ droidports](https://github.com/JohnnyonFlame/droidports) loader that makes this possible.
