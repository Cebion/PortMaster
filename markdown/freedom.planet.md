## Notes

Be sure the freedomplanet/gamedata folder on you sd card contains subfolders named bin32, bin64 and Data. 

The runtime folder and the run.sh file is not needed and should be left out or it will cause a double entry for Freedom Planet in the ports section of Emulationstation. 

There should also be a filed named Assets.dat in freedomplanet/gamedata as well. 

Then run Freedom Planet from the Emulationstation ports menu.
Note: This game can take a minute or two to initially load.
