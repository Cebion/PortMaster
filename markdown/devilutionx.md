## Notes

Copy diabdat.mpq from your CD or GoG installation (or extract it from the GoG installer) into /roms/ports/devilution folder. 

Do not delete the gamecontrollerdb.txt file in the /roms/ports/devilution folder or there will be no controller support in the game! For controls, see here

**Important Note: ** Itâ€™s been reported that you must make sure you use the GOG version of diabdat.mpq with the newest patch_rt.mpq or you may experience a freeze of the game around level 20.

If you experience issues after a version upgrade, backup your save file and uninstall/reinstall the port.

If you make a config change that crashes the game, you can delete the ini file to get the game back to a good state

Thanks to the [diasurgical](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX) team for the source port that makes this possible.
