## Notes

Thanks to the [MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame) project for the framework that's used to make this possible.
Thanks to JohnnyonFlame for the port work that makes this possible.

## Detailed Instructions

You must have a copy of the [compatibility version](https://www.stardewvalley.net/compatibility/) of Stardew Valley. 

Steam or GOG versions should work. If purchasing the game, have in mind that there is no GOG compatibility version for linux, as that requires using GOG Galaxy, which doesn't support linux at all. 

Windows compatibility version works fine. Copy data into the ports/stardewvalley/gamedata folder
