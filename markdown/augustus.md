## Notes

 You can buy a digital copy from GOG or Steam, or you can use an original CD-ROM version. Install the game files into ports/augustus/data, here are some excellent instructions from the[ Julius project](https://github.com/bvschaik/julius/wiki/Running-Julius) (which Augustus is a fork of). If installing from the CD's you'll need to get the [latest patches](https://github.com/bvschaik/julius/wiki/Patches).
 
 
Thanks to [Keriew](https://github.com/Keriew/augustus) for this modified version of the open source julius port from [Bianca van Schaik](hhttps://github.com/bvschaik/julius) and other contributors. Also thanks to Kloptops for the packaging for portmaster and Cebion for the controls work.
