## Notes

You must have a copy of the Sonic The Hedgehog Classic Android APK then do the following:

1. Using 7Zip, open the apk and extract /assets/Data.rsdk.xmf.
2. Rename the Data.rsdk.xmf to Data.rsdk. Case is important!
3. Copy the Data.rsdk file to the ports/sonic2 folder.
4. If all is well, you should be able to run Sonic 2 now.
5. For a video of what to do, check out Retro Game Corps' video guide here.
