## Notes

They can be bought at either [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/) or [GOG.com](https://www.gog.com/game/rollercoaster_tycoon_2). If you have the original RollerCoaster Tycoon and its expansion packs, you can point OpenRCT2 to these in order to play the original scenarios

Thanks to [OpenRCT2 team](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2) for creating this opensource port.  Also thanks to [kloptops](https://github.com/kloptops/Portmaster-misc/tree/main/OpenRCT2) for the porting work for portmaster.
