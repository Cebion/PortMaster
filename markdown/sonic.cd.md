## Notes

To open the mod menu press L3

 You must have a copy of the Sonic CD Classic Android APK then do the following:

1. Using 7Zip, open the apk and extract Androind/obb/comm.sega.soniccd.classic/patch49.com.sega.soniccd.classic.obb.
2. This file may have a different number such as patch56 or higher which should also work as well.
3. Rename the patch49.com.sega.soniccd.classic.obb to Data.rsdk. Case is important!
4. Copy the Data.rsdk file to the ports/soniccd folder.
5. If all is well, you should be able to run Sonic CD now.
6. For a video of what to do, check out Retro Game Corps' video guide here.
Note: There seems to be an issue with being able to consistently exit Sonic CD through the menu like you can with Sonic 1 and 2. You can exit Sonic CD by holding Select and pressing Start. (For the RGB10, you can hold Minus and press Start. For the Chi, you can hold the 1 key and press Start.)


Thanks to [Rubberduckycooly](https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/Sonic-CD-11-Decompilation) for the decompilation work that makes this possible.
