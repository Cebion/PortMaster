## Notes

1. Be sure the folder contains subfolders named 32, 64 and data. There should also be a filed named ShovelKnight.
2. Copy the shovelknight folder to the roms/ports folder on your device.


For PortMaster version, copy your Shovel Knight Treasure Trove for Linux folder to the ports/shovelknight/gamedata folder.  You should have ports/shovelknight/gamedata/shovelknight folder structure with additional subfolders such as 32, 64, and data within ports/shovelknight/gamedata/shovelknight.  Once done, just run Shovel Knight.sh.
