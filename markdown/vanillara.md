## Notes

If you want to play the full version, you will need to place at least MAIN.MIX & READALERT.MIX into ports/vanillara/data/vanillara. 

You can get the game files from [here](https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Vanilla-Conquer#vanillatd-and-vanillara). For multiple cd's for the campaigns & expansions it is a little more complex. Follow the installation instructions from here.<br>  If you want to use the expansions you will need the files from the patch 3.03, available [here](https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Vanilla-Conquer/wiki/Installing-VanillaRA).


Thanks to [TheAssemblyArmada](https://github.com/TheAssemblyArmada/Vanilla-Conquer) and other contributors for the build.  Also thanks to kloptops and Snoopy from the AmberElec Discord for the porting work.
