## Notes

You'll need A copy of the black gate and/or serpent isle added to ports/exult/data/blackgate and/or ports/exult/data/serpentisle. 

If done correctly there will be a ports/exult/data/blackgate/static and ports/exult/data/serpentisle/static folder. 

You’ll also need a copy of an existing saved game or you won’t be able to start a game session. 


Thanks to the [Exult Team](https://github.com/exult/exult) for the Exult engine that makes this possible.
