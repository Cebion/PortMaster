## Notes

* For Steam or Preinstalled GOG:

				* Copy data into the ports/iconoclasts/gamedata folder
				* Be sure the folder contains subfolders named 32, 64 and data
* Alternatively, from GOG's self-installer:

				* Rename the installer (e.g. iconoclasts_1_15_chinese_24946.sh) extension from .sh to .gz
				* Then use 7zip to open the installer and grab the contents of the game folder (bin32, bin64, data and Assets.dat) and place it in the ports/iconoclasts/gamedata folder


**This game is best played on devices with a 640x480 screen resolution or higher!**
