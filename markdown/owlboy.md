## Notes

**This game is best played on devices with at least a 5" screen.**  It is somewhat feasible on the 3.5" 640x480 device like the Chi, RG351MP or RG351V.  Text is not legible on the 480x320 devices such as the RG351P/M, RGB10, or RK2020.
Thanks to the [FNA-XNA](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA) project for the runtime that's used to make this possible.
Thanks to JohnnyonFlame for the port work that makes this possible.
