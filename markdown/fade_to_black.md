## Credits

Itâ€™s been reported that only the US based CD version of Fade to Black works with this port.
(Europe and downsized US DOSBox versions are not compatible even when all files are present).  Thanks to waeggy123 for reporting this.
Thanks to [cyxx](https://github.com/cyxx/f2bgl) for the Fade to Black engine reimplementation that makes this possible.  Also thanks to romadu for the porting work for portmaster.
